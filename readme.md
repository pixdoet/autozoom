# Autozoom  
A project I made that automatically opens links based on a loaded JSON file.  

# Requirements  
## Software  
- Git
- Python 3 (doesn't work on 2, formatted strings etc etc)  
- PHP (any version with JSON support will do)  

## Pip  
See requirements.txt. Install with `python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt`  

# Running  
Clone the repo `git clone https://github.com/pixdoet/autozoom.git` into a local folder. Inside the folder, modify and run `php generator.php` to generate the JSON file, then run `python3 main.py` to start the main file. NOTE: You only need to run generator.php once unless you change your timetable.

# To Do  
- Rework `generator.php` into Python  
- Write better documentation.  
- Write a GUI for creating timetables.  

# Credits  
Me I guess.
